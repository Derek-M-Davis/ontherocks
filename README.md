#### Original Goal:
> Having an website that is usable on mobile to help those decesion shy people with narrowing their adult beverage choices. After choosing your beverage a seperate tab of news stories, talking point while out with friends, coworkers and strangers to avoid akward silence. If you actually like the people around you and trust them not to drop your phone without a case, a game revolving around the jeopardy api we worked with earlier with a fifteen second timer for each question with a screen flash to another color to signify times up. 

#### Technologies Used

  -MVC Structure
  -MEAN Stack(MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js)  
  -ThecocktailDB (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
  -CSS - Bootstrap
  -Heroku Hosting application and CLI

#### Approach Taken
>Primary goal was to make a robust interface that is intuative to make the decision process as quick as possible weither you are ordering out or looking for ideas to make something at home. Seeding the data with our ajax calls then designing around partials to make the webpage as clean and distraction free. 

#### Challenges
Working within branches as a team for the first time we quickly found a flaw in our process of not pushing to our master branch when utilizing Heroku. While we reached out to the internet, classmates, our trusty TA and project leader we soon found over six hours of debugging order, talking and referring to past projects that worked and eventually did start from scratch unknowingly our only issue was Heroku not caring about other branches besides the master. It takes from master reguardless of your changes being pushed from our dev branch. Being behind by almost a day and being extremly frustrated with out oversight we did move forward.
